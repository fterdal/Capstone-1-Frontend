        <h2>How our voting system works</h2>
        <p className="styled-paragraph">
          We use a method called <strong>Instant Runoff Voting (IRV)</strong>,
          also known as <strong>ranked-choice voting</strong>. Voters rank all
          available options in order of preferenceâ€”1st, 2nd, 3rd, and so on.
        </p>
        <p className="styled-paragraph">
          If no option receives a majority of first-choice votes, the option
          with the fewest is eliminated, and those votes are transferred to each
          voter's next preferred option. This elimination process continues in
          rounds until one option has a majority.
        </p>
        <p className="styled-paragraph">
          This ensures the winner is the most broadly accepted choice rather
          than just the most popular first pick.
